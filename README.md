# Contacts Project on 3-Tier Architecture - Console App

**Repository Name:** `3-Tier-Architecture-Practice-Prep`

This repository contains a practice project that demonstrates the implementation of a 3-Tier Architecture in a console application. The project is designed for those looking to solidify their understanding of multi-layered application development and how to properly separate concerns within an application.

## Project Overview

The Contacts Project is a simple console-based application that allows users to manage a list of contacts. It serves as a practical example of the 3-Tier Architecture, consisting of the following layers:

1. **Presentation Layer:** The user interface of the application, implemented as a console application, which interacts with the user by collecting input and displaying output.

2. **Business Logic Layer (BLL):** This layer contains the core business logic of the application. It processes user input, validates data, and applies the business rules for managing contacts.

3. **Data Access Layer (DAL):** This layer is responsible for interacting with the data source (SQL Server) using ADO.NET. It performs CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the contacts data.

## Key Features

- **Separation of Concerns:** Demonstrates how to separate the application into distinct layers, each with its own responsibilities.
- **Clean Code:** Follows best practices for code organization and architecture.
- **Scalability:** Provides a foundation that can be expanded into a more complex application with additional layers, such as a service layer or an API.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and open the solution in your preferred IDE. The project is designed to be simple, with clear code comments and documentation to help you understand the flow of data through the layers.

## Requirements

- .NET Framework or .NET Core
- SQL Server
- Basic understanding of C#, ADO.NET, and object-oriented programming
